## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Dynamic UI Updates: By integrating fetch with JSON data, I learned how to dynamically update the UI based on user interactions, allowing for real-time content changes depending on the selected time period (daily, weekly, or monthly).

Event Handling: I enhanced my understanding of event handling by implementing click events to highlight the active time period and update the displayed data accordingly.

Destructuring in JavaScript: I utilized destructuring to simplify the process of extracting and manipulating data from complex JSON objects, making my code more readable and efficient.

Conditional Rendering: Through conditional logic, I was able to effectively display different sets of data based on user selection, which improved the flexibility and interactivity of the application.

### Continued development

Deeper API Integration: Moving forward, I aim to delve deeper into API fetching, promises, and async/await patterns to enhance the responsiveness and performance of my projects.

Performance Optimization: I plan to explore ways to optimize DOM manipulation for larger datasets, ensuring that my applications remain fast and efficient as they scale.

Error Handling: I will work on improving error handling mechanisms to make my code more robust and capable of dealing with unexpected data or network issues.
